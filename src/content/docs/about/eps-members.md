We consider all European Python users and [EuroPython](/about/europython) attendees as having a say in the workings of the EPS, since we regard the EPS as representation of the EuroPython attendees and want to serve the European Python community in the best way possible.

Initially, the EPS was focused on organizing the EuroPython conference, working hard to make every single EuroPython conference a professional, high quality and fun event.

Since 2016, we have [broadened the focus](/about/mission/) to be able to support the European Python community in general.

If you have suggestions for enhancements, changes or anything we could do to make EuroPython an even better event, or better support Python in Europe, please [contact us](/about/contact).

### EPS Membership

We are constantly aiming at increasing our membership size to make sure that we can fulfill our intention to represent the EuroPython attendees.

Please see our membership roster page for a list of our current members:

[EuroPython Society Membership Roster](/about/roster/)

****Membership is free**** and our bylaws only require you to have attended a EuroPython conference or are registered as attendee for the next edition.

If you would like to have a say in the organization, or simply show your support by being a society member, please consider signing up.

üêç**Become a EuroPython** **Organiser**  
Other than signing up as a EPS membership, you can also contribute by joining one of our [EuroPython Teams](/about/europython-teams/) to help us organise the EuroPython conference!### Sign up as EPS Member

Our [bylaws](/about/bylaws) do require members to be voted in by the board and because this hasn‚Äôt been done in the past, the new board is working towards getting all EuroPython attendees who want to have official voting rights in the EPS General Assembly signed up as EPS members.

To sign up as member, please enter your details in our ****[EuroPython Society Membership Application form](/about/application/)****,

The board will collect these application and then vote on them in batches during the year and in time for the next general assembly at the conference, so that you can also officially participate in the voting process.

Once you are voted in, we will sign you up to the EuroPython members mailing list and send you a welcome email.

### EPS Member Resources

* [EuroPython Society Members Mailing List](https://www.egenix.com/mailman/listinfo/europython-members)  
This is a private mailing list for EPS members. All EPS members are invited to this list. All EPS communication relevant for members is sent to this list. Public announcements are also posted on our [EPS blog](/about/).

### [EPS Board Members](#eps-board-members)

**What does the EPS Board do ?**

The EPS board is made up of up to 9 directors (including 1 chair and 1 vice chair) as per the [EPS bylaws](/about/bylaws); the board runs the day\-to\-day business of the EuroPython Society, including running the EuroPython conference series, and supports the community through various initiatives such as our grants programme. The board collectively takes up the fiscal and legal responsibility of the Society.

At the moment, running the annual EuroPython conference is a major task for the EPS. As such, the board members are expected to invest significant time and effort towards overseeing the smooth execution of the conference, ranging from venue selection, contract negotiations, and budgeting, to volunteer management. Every board member has the duty to support one or more EuroPython teams to facilitate decision\-making and knowledge transfer.

In addition, the Society prioritises building a close relationship with local communities. Board members should not only be passionate about the Python community but have a high\-level vision and plan for how the EPS could best serve the community.

The EPS General Assembly votes on a new board members once a year. This section lists the board members by terms.
