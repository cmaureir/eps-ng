> ****Please note:**** In the past, the EPS did CFPs for EuroPython conferences. In 2017 we switched to a different model based on commercial RFPs for venues to participate in. This page lists the CFPs we have run in the past.

The EPS regularly does calls for participation to put on EuroPython conferences. If possible, we usually announce our decisions at the EuroPython conferences.

****Call for EuroPython 2017****

Please see our [EuroPython 2017 Call for Participation page](/about/cfp-2017). If you want to prepare for the CFI and CFP, please have a look at the [call for 2015 page](/about/cfp-2015) for details. The decision for the on\-site team for EuroPython 2017 and thus the location for 2017 will be announced late in September.

****Call for EuroPython 2016****

There was no call for EuroPython 2016, since the on\-site team was willing to run a second year and the EPS board was very happy with the collaboration.

****Call for EuroPython 2015****

Please see our [EuroPython 2015 Call for Participation page](/about/cfp-2015) and [EuroPython Workgroups: Call for Volunteers blog post](/about/post/99718376575/europython-workgroups-call-for-volunteers) for details on the 2015 concepts and selection process.

****Call for EuroPython 2014****

Please see our [Call for Proposals 2014 page](/about/cfp-2014) for details on the 2014 concepts and selection process.

****Call for EuroPython 2013****

Please see our [Call for Proposals 2013 page](/about/cfp-2013) for details on the 2013 selection process.

****Call for EuroPython 2011****

Please see our [Call for Proposals 2011 page](/about/cfp-2011) for details on the 2011 selection process.

****Earlier CFPs****

We will make CFPs for earlier EuroPython editions available as well, if thereâ€™s interest. [Any help](/about/contact) with this is appreciated.
