The [EuroPython Society (EPS)](/about/) is a Swedish non\-profit organization which organizes [EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) conferences, supports the Python community in Europe and holds the rights to the [EuroPython conference series](/about/europython) and [trademarks](/about/trademarks).

The EPS was formed in 2004, with the mission to turn EuroPython into a successful [Python](http://www.python.org/) conference series for the years to come. In 2016, we have extended our [mission](/about/mission) to further the use of the programming language Python in Europe and organize events centered around the programming language Python to support this.
