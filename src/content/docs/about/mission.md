****New mission since July 2016****


> The EuroPython Societyâ€™s mission is to further the use of the programming language Python in Europe and organize events centered around the programming language Python to support this.

In other words, the [EuroPython Society (EPS)](http://europython-society.org/) is here to help in a similar way as the [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](http://python.org/psf/) does internationally, but with a special focus on Europe. We hope to strengthen the ties in the European Python community over the coming years and will use the [EuroPython](/about/mission#mce_temp_url#) conference series as platform for this.

****Previous mission****

The mission was broadened from our previous mission in July 2016, which was to organize the volunteer run [EuroPython](/about/europython) conferences and make sure that each of the conferences is an interesting, inspiring and fun event for all attendees.

For many years, this has been done in an ad\-hoc fashion, but with the growth of [EuroPython](/about/europython) \- we have surpassed the 1000 attendee mark in [2014](http://ep2014.europython.eu/) \- a more formal procedure was introduced. For [2015](http://ep2015.europython.eu/), we have [started a new workgroup based approach](/about/post/99718376575/europython-workgroups-call-for-volunteers) to achieve our goal. We are now working with [several volunteer workgroups](/about/workgroups) and an on\-site team which changes from location to location.

All [board members](/about/members) have many years experience in organizing [Python](http://www.python.org/) conferences and we will strive to put this experience to good use to assure that EuroPython conferences continue to maintain the high quality which EuroPython attendees expect from a EuroPython conference.
