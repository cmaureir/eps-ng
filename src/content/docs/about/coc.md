title: EuroPython Society Code of Conduct
description: ...
---

EuroPython is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers, and volunteers at any EuroPython event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct, as set forth by the [EuroPython Society](/about/about/). Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## OUR COMMUNITY

Members of the Python community are open, considerate, and **respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labour was completed simply for the good of the community.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers.
* **Being respectful.** We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## OUR STANDARDS

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, cultural and cognitive variations, or socio\-economic status.

## INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* Harassment of any participants in any form
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self\-harm
* Creating additional online accounts to harass another person or circumvent a ban
* Language and imagery in online communities or any conference venue, including talks, that sexualises, insults, demeans, or attacks groups or specific individuals
* Insults, put\-downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in\-person presentations, or other in\-person events
* Continued one\-on\-one communication after requests to cease
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

### BE PROFESSIONAL AND DON'T SPAM

We consider EuroPython a great setting to showcase the work of the community and would like to encourage networking and business related discussions, as well as keep the conference presentations meaningful and interesting for everyone.

We therefore:

* primarily make company marketing, promotional or recruiting\-related activities at the conference available to our paid sponsors, unless agreed otherwise;
* request presentations \- outside the official recruiting sessions \- to focus on Python\-related topics, not on recruitment.

The [EuroPython Sponsor team](mailto:sponsoring@europython.eu) will be happy to answer any questions related to marketing or recruiting activities.

## CONSEQUENCES

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the EuroPython Community Code of Conduct team may take action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets.

More details are published in the **[Procedures for Incident Response](/about/coc-enforcement-procedure/)** document.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
