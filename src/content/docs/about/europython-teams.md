## Overview

In 2022, after multiple discussions with past and current volunteers, we reworked the [Workgroup structure](/about/workgroups/) in place 2015 and 2021\. We aim to have a more balanced workload between contributors in different teams, and give more autonomy to them while reducing the silos between teams. 

We hope you like it. If you have any suggestions, email us: plaza@europython.eu. 

Or better, **join us to improve it**: volunteers@europython.eu
