The EuroPython Society (EPS) welcomes grant proposals for European Python conferences and events.

Going forward, we will also accept grant requests for European projects related to the development of Python, Python\-related technology, educational programs and resources, but for now, we have to restrict ourselves mostly to conferences and events in order to keep the review process simple.

If you have questions about the Grants program, please read the FAQ and then direct questions to [board@europython.eu](mailto:board@europython.eu).

## [Guido van Rossum Core Developer Grant](#guido-van-rossum-core-developer-grant)

Starting with EuroPython 2019, we are offering free tickets to Python Core Developers to help support their efforts, provide a platform to get together for face to face meetings and to support finding new core developers.

Please see our [Guido van Rossum Core Developer Grant page](/about/core-grant) for details.

### [EuroPython Fellow Grant](#europython-fellow-grant)

In order to recognize and show gratitude towards members of the EPS and the EuroPython Workgroups who have contributed significantly towards our mission, the EuroPython conference and the Society as an organization, the EuroPython Society Board has instantiated a new EuroPython Fellow Grant in 2021\.

[EuroPython Fellows](/about/europython-society-fellow-grant/#fellows) are eligible for a lifetime free attendance of the EuroPython conference and workshops.

Please see our [EuroPython Society Fellow Grant page](/about/europython-society-fellow-grant/) for details.

## [Grant Proposals](#grant-proposals)

Proposals should be for specific Python conferences. We cannot sponsor user group events, meetups, sprints or similar smaller events at this time. Proposals should be brief (two pages of text at maximum), and they should explain:

1. A conference introduction, including the expected number of attendees and scope of the conference.
2. The date by which funding must be received.
3. The expected grant size, including the motivation for choosing the size. Please note that the EPS may decide to fund only part of the requested size.
4. A description of the beneficiaries of the grant, including a mention of whether the organizers themselves may personally benefit from the grant.
5. A description of the planned grant follow\-up activities. We would like to see how the grant was used, so please send in information on how the grant was put to good use for the Python community. This could be blog postings, post\-event write\-ups, conference web pages, etc.
6. A contact person or group of persons, with which we can communicate regarding the grant and the conference. The EPS would like to actively build relationships with European Python organizers and possibly send speakers or representatives to the conference.

To submit a grant proposal please send an email to [grants@europython.eu](mailto:grants@europython.eu) and please leave at least 4 weeks prior to the event for us to review the request and possibly get back to you with questions.

We will be in touch by email to let you know whether we decided to sponsor the event or not. For sponsorships, we require a VAT invoice written to the EPS for the grant amount:


> EuroPython Society  
> Ramnebacken 45  
> 424 38 Agnesberg  
> Sweden  
> VAT\-ID: [SE802417770401](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vatResponse.html?action=check&check=Verify&memberStateCode=SE&number=802417770401&requesterMemberStateCode=&requesterNumber=&traderCity=&traderName=&traderPostalCode=&traderStreet=)

The invoice should to provide SEPA money transfer details to render the payment in EUR. We also support PayPal and TransferWise for payments, but prefer SEPA due to the low costs.

### Example Grant Proposal

*Grant Proposal*: The next annual PyCon Portugal will be taking place this June, and sponsorship from the EuroPython Society (EPS) would be much appreciated.

*Grant objective*: In an effort to keep our ticket prices affordable, we’ve secured corporate sponsorship to cover the catering costs, and are hoping that the EPS will be able to help us pay for the venue rental and A/V fees. The conference runs Friday to Sunday, and the venue rental fee is EUR 1000 per day. The A/V costs are EUR 1500 for the whole weekend.

*Grant size*: EUR 2000 total to help cover the costs. To thank you for your sponsorship, we will place the EPS logo on our site and offer you 2 free tickets to PyCon Portugal to distribute as you see fit.

*Grant beneficiaries*: We are expecting 300 attendees this year. We will also be recording the talks, and will make them available online a few days after the event.

*Grant follow\-up*: We will post a summary of PyCon Portugal on our blog and mention that the EPS sponsored the event. The EPS will receive an email pointing to the blog post once it is published, as well as additional pictures from the conference.

### Grant Recognition

Please put our [logo (with text)](/about/logos) up on your website. We usually do not ask for anything else, but if you’d like to offer freebies to our EuroPython community, we won’t reject them either :\-)

### Sharing Zoom Licenses

In addition to financial grants, we can also share our Zoom licenses with the community, or get new ones on our business account. Please see our [Conference Resources](/about/resources) page for details.

### Publicity Aid

We can help you spread the word by retweeting your conference announcements on the [EuroPython twitter channel](http://twitter.com/europython). Please send us the tweet URL once you’re ready with the tweet.

## [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#frequently-asked-questions-faq-)

Q. Is there a maximum grant size that can be awarded?

A. There is no set maximum, but we want to distributed grants with consideration to the conference sizes, needs and benefit for the community, all subject to our available budget.

Q. I am running a Python conference. How big a grant should I ask for?

A. The conference grant size is typically between EUR 5\-10 per attendee as guideline. The EPS does not have big pockets as the PSF does, so we try to use our available budget in a way that balance the overall effectiveness with the number of grants we can issue.

Q. Is there anything I need to know about fund disbursements?

A. We can only make payments at an organization\-to\-organization level due to EU regulations. We prefer to make SEPA payments in EUR, but can also render payments via PayPal or TransferWise.

Q. Are there any restrictions on how I describe receiving a grant from the EPS?

A. Yes, there are. Specifically, the EPS awarding a grant to support a conference is not an endorsement of the conference and should not be represented as such. Texts such as “Sponsored by the EuroPython Society” or “Supported by the EuroPython Society” are fine.
