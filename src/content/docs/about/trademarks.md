### Usage Guidelines for the “EuroPython” word mark

Please note that these abbreviations are often used as abbreviations for third\-party trademarks. As a result, special care has to be taken, when using them. Other forms of abbreviations are not permitted.
* ****Styling.**** The word mark “EuroPython” consists of the two works “Euro” and “Python”.
