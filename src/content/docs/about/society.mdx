The **EuroPython Society (EPS)** is a Swedish non-profit organization which
organizes [EuroPython](https://www.europython.eu) conferences, supports the
Python community in Europe and holds the rights to the EuroPython [conference
series](conference) and [trademarks](trademarks).

The EPS was formed in 2004, with the mission to turn EuroPython into
a successful [Python](https://python.org) conference series for the years to
come. In 2016, we have extended [our mission](mission) to further the use of
the programming language Python in Europe and organize events centered around
the programming language Python to support this.
